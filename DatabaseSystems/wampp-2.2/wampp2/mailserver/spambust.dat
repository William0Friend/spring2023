#
# This set of rules is intended to catch a wide range of unwanted mail
# messages where the content is commercial or sexual in nature. It works
# quite well (at the time of writing anyway) but you will almost certainly
# want or need to adjust it over time to deal with the specific types of
# content you want to filter. This rule set is designed to be used with a
# definition where the trigger weight is set to 50.
#
# Note that many of the rules in this file have negative weights: this is
# a useful way of "promoting" a message that might otherwise be detected
# as having unacceptable content.
#

# Check for an unreasonable number of spaces in the subject

# The following group of rules is intended to allow "joke mail", which
# often has somewhat smutty content, to pass through unhindered. If you
# are happy to allow "joke mail" at your site, uncomment the set of rules
# by removing the '#' symbol at the start of each line.
#
